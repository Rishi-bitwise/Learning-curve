# Learning-curve
Some of the projects that I have worked on my own, to develop a deeper understanding of numerical methods and physics simulation. There was no plan for pushing any of it to github, as it was a personal learning sandbox,
but versioning is becoming a challenge.

About my work:

MCMC models are something that I find myself better suited to make more projects in. Although some integration methods need some studying my multivariable calculus is decent, now.

Time Series Analysis needs more analytical work to understand how things work beneath it all. Very fascinating field indeed.

Simulations are fun to watch, the Lagrangians do the heavy lifting. Especially smp.solve and odeint. 2-D mesh was a real learning experience. I still have to work on the meshed/coupled pendulums,
they keep failing for some reason. maybe it is a numerical issue, it needs to be investigated further.
